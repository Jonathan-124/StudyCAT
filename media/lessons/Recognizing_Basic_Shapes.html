There are many ways to describe everyday objects we can see. For example, let's say you see a pizza in front of you.
You could say that it tastes delicious, and you would be describing its taste.
You could say that it seems big, and you would be describing its size.
You could say that it looks round, and you would be describing its <b>shape</b>.
Each and every object that we can see has an outline/form, and we call this their shape.
Because many objects have similar shapes, we have names for the most common shapes we see in daily life.
The four most common shapes are the <b>triangle</b>, the <b>square</b>, the <b>rectangle</b>, and the <b>circle</b>, as seen below.
