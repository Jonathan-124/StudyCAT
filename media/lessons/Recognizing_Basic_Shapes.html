Each and every object that we can see has an outline/form, and we call this their <b>shape</b>.
<br>
Because many shapes have similar properties, we can categorize these shapes based on their properties.
<br><br>
We can broadly categorize shapes into two categories: <b>two-dimensional shapes</b> and <b>three-dimensional shapes</b>.
<br><br>
A two-dimensional shape (or <b>2D shape</b>) is any "flat" shape that does not have any thickness. For example, a piece of paper takes the form of a 2D shape because it is flat and has no thickness.
<br>
A three-dimensional shape (or <b>3D shape</b>) is any shape that is not flat. In other words, it has some depth/thickness. For example, a ball takes the form of a 3D shape.
<br><br>
Because three dimensional shapes are difficult to represent on a flat surface like the screen you are using right now, we sometimes use a combination of solid and dashed lines to show depth.
<br>
Here are examples of a 2D shape and a 3D shape respectively.
