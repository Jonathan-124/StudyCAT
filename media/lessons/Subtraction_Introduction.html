Let's start with an example. If I had 8 cookies and ate 3 of them, how many cookies would I have left?
<br>
I'm sure we can all figure out that we would be left with 5 remaining cookies. But let's take a step back and think about how we got the answer.
We first counted that we had 8 cookies in total. Then, we took away 3 cookies from the total amount of cookies by counting 3 backwards from 8, which gave us 5 as the answer.
<br><br>
In short, we have performed <b>subtraction</b>!
When you have a group of things (cookies in this case), and want to know how much remains after you take away a portion of them,
you <b>subtract</b> the total number by the number you are taking away. In other words, you first count the total number of things you have.
Then, count backwards the number that was taken away. What you get is the number of things that remain!
<br><br>
To rephrase what we did in the example more simply, we could say '8 minus 3 ', where <b>minus</b> is another way to say 'subtract'.
We can also use the symbol \( - \) (called a <b>minus sign</b>) instead to represent the same concept as
$$ 8 - 3 $$
Since the result of \( 8-3 \) is equal to 5, we can also write
$$ 8-3=5 $$
The result of subtraction (the number on the right of the equals sign) is also called the <b>difference</b>. In this example, we say the difference between 8 and 3 is 5.

Let's go through some exercises.

<div class="card">
    <div class="card-header">
        <h5>Exercise 1</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
        <p>Fill in the blank. $$ 5-2= \square$$</p>
        <br>
        <a class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" href="#ex1-solution" onclick="this.innerHTML = (this.innerHTML == 'Show solution' ? 'Hide solution' : 'Show solution');" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="ex1-solution">Show solution</a>
    </div>
    <div id="ex1-solution" class="collapse hide" aria-labelledby="ex1-solution">
        <div class="card-footer">
            The correct answer is \( 3 \).
            <br><br>
            We first count to 5. Then, we count 2 backwards from 5 to get 3.
            Because the difference of \( 5-2 \) is equal to the number 3, \( 5-2=3 \).
        </div>

<div class="card">
    <div class="card-header">
        <h5>Exercise 2</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
        <p>Jenny has nine books and gives four books to Michelle. How many books does Jenny have remaining?</p>
        <br>
        <a class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" href="#ex2-solution" onclick="this.innerHTML = (this.innerHTML == 'Show solution' ? 'Hide solution' : 'Show solution');" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="ex2-solution">Show solution</a>
    </div>
    <div id="ex2-solution" class="collapse hide" aria-labelledby="ex2-solution">
        <div class="card-footer">
            The correct answer is 5.
            <br><br>
            First, let's write the numbers using digits. Jenny has 9 books originally, and 4 are being taken away.
            Because we want to find how many books remain after we take away 4 books from a total of 9, we subtract the two numbers and write it as \( 9-4 \).
            Finally, the difference of \( 9-4 \) is 5, which is the number of books Jenny has remaining.

To summarize subtraction:
<ul>
  <li>We subtract when we want to calculate the number of things that remain when we remove some things from a group of things</li>
  <li>We subtract by counting backwards from the total number by the number of things we are removing</li>
  <li>Subtraction is represented by the minus sign (\( - \))</li>
  <li>The number in front of the minus sign is the total number of things, and the number after the minus sign is the number of things we are removing</li>
  <li>The result of subtraction is called the difference</li>
</ul>
</p>
