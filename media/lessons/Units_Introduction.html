    We use <b>units</b> of measurement to give both context and scale to what we are measuring. The unit of measurement often comes after a number that indicates the quantity of what we are measuring.
    <br><br>
    For example, imagine that you and your friend are working on a group project. You ask your friend how long it will take to finish their part, and your friend answers "5 minutes".
    In this example, the word "minutes" in your friend's answer is the unit and the number 5 is the quantity. The unit gives us the context of what we are measuring (time), as well as the scale of measurement (how much time each minute takes, we therefore know how much time 5 minutes takes.
    <br><br>
    Even when there is no "background story" that gives context to what a number is measuring, if a number is attached to a unit of measurement, we can often tell both the context and the scale.
    <br><br>
    For example, "6 meters" is the number 6 with the unit of "meter" attached to it. Just by looking at this unit we know that the number is measuring some kind of distance. Because we know the scale of each unit (how much distance each meter measures) as well as the quantity we are measuring (6), we therefore know how long 12 meters is.

                The correct answer is the second choice, "Unit: Dollars; Quantity: 9".
                <br><br>
                We are asked for the unit and quantity of the price of the vacuum cleaner and not its cleaning time, therefore the bottom two choices are incorrect.
                The unit (dollars) gives the context context and scale to what we are measuring, while the quantity is a number that indicates an amount (9), therefore the second choice is correct.
                Be careful not to confuse the unit and quantity like what happened in the first and third choices!

    A concept can have many units, where each unit has a different scale. For example, distance can be measured by units such as inches, miles, millimeters, kilometers, etc., but each of these units have different lengths, and therefore having a same quantity but different units would mean different lengths (10 inches is not the same as 10 miles).

                The correct answer is the third choice, "Fahrenheit".
                <br><br>
                Seconds, weeks and years are all units that measure time, while Fahrenheit is a unit that measures temperature.
