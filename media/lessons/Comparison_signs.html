  In daily life, we can <b>compare</b> similar things in many ways.
  <br><br>
  For example, here are a couple of ways we can compare two similar things:
  <ul>
    <li>Alice's hair is <i>darker</i> than Bob's hair.</li>
    <li>Charlie's room is <i>cleaner</i> than Diana's room.</li>
    <li>Ernie's car is <i>bigger</i> than Fred's car.</li>
  </ul>
  Notice how in each example, we are using words in <i>italics</i> to compare similar things (hair, rooms, and cars in each example).
  <br><br>
  We can do similar things with numbers!
  You might be thinking that a number cannot be 'darker' or 'cleaner' than another number, and you would be correct.
  The only way numbers can be compared is by comparing their <i>amount</i>.
  <br><br>
  Here are some examples where we compare two numbers:
  <ul>
    <li>The number 2 is <i>greater</i> than the number 1.</li>
    <li>The number 4 is <i>less</i> than the number 9.</li>
    <li>The number 5 is <i>equal</i> to the number 5.</li>
  </ul>
  An important thing to keep in mind is that when we compare two numbers, there are only three possible outcomes:
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li>The first number is greater than the second number. For example, 3 is greater than 0.</li>
    <li>The first number is less than the second number. For example, 1 is less than 5.</li>
    <li>The first number is equal to the second number. For example, 6 is equal to 6.</li>
  </ol>
  Because typing out sentences like these takes too much work, we have invented the following three <b>signs</b> to make it easier to represent these ideas:
  <table class="table w-auto">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">Sign</th>
          <th scope="col">Name of Sign</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
        <tr>
          <td>$$>$$</td>
          <td>Greater-than sign</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>$$<$$</td>
          <td>Less-than sign</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>$$=$$</td>
          <td>Equals sign</td>
        </tr>
  </table>
  The <b>greater-than sign</b> (\( > \)) is used when the number on the left is greater than the number on the right.<br>
  For example, we write '3 is greater than 0' as \( 3>0 \) using the greater-than sign.
  <br><br>
  The <b>less-than sign</b> (\( < \)) is used when the number on the left is less than the number on the right.<br>
  For example, we write '1 is less than 5' as \( 1<5 \) using the less-than sign.
  <br><br>
  The <b>equals sign</b> (\( = \)) is used when the number on the left is the same as the number on the right.<br>
  For example, we write '6 is equal to 6' as \( 6=6 \) using the equals sign.
  <br><br>
  This little trick might help you tell the greater-than and less-than signs apart:
<b>The pointy end of the sign always points to the smaller number.</b>
<br>
  In the first example \( 3>0 \), 3 is bigger than 0, so the pointy end points to the 0.
  In the second example \( 1<5 \), 1 is smaller than 5, so the pointy end points to the 1.
