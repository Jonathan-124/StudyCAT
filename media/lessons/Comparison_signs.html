<p>
  In daily life, we can <b>compare</b> things in many ways.
  <br><br>
  For example, here are a couple of ways we can compare two similar things:
  <ul>
    <li>Alice's hair is <i>darker</i> than Bob's hair.</li>
    <li>Charlie's room is <i>cleaner</i> than Diana's room.</li>
    <li>Ernie's car is <i>bigger</i> than Fred's car.</li>
  </ul>
  Notice how in each example, we are using words in <i>italics</i> to compare similar things (hair, rooms, and cars to be specific).
  <br><br>
  We can do similar things with numbers!
  You might be thinking that a number cannot be 'darker' or 'cleaner' than another number, and you would be correct.
  The only way numbers can be compared is by comparing their <i>amounts</i>.
  <br><br>
  Here are some examples where we compare two numbers:
  <ul>
    <li>Two is <i>greater</i> than one.</li>
    <li>Four is <i>less</i> than nine.</li>
    <li>Five is <i>equal</i> to five.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="card">
      <div class="card-header">
          <h5>Exercise 1</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
          <p>Which of the following statements is correct?</p>
          <div class="custom-control custom-radio">
              <input type="radio" id="ex1-radio1" name="exercise1" class="custom-control-input">
              <label class="custom-control-label" for="ex1-radio1">3 is greater than 4</label>
          </div>
          <div class="custom-control custom-radio">
              <input type="radio" id="ex1-radio2" name="exercise1" class="custom-control-input">
              <label class="custom-control-label" for="ex1-radio2">7 is equal to 5</label>
          </div>
              <div class="custom-control custom-radio">
              <input type="radio" id="ex1-radio3" name="exercise1" class="custom-control-input">
              <label class="custom-control-label" for="ex1-radio3">1 is less than 3</label>
          </div>
          <br>
          <a class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" href="#ex1-solution" onclick="this.innerHTML = (this.innerHTML == 'Show solution' ? 'Hide solution' : 'Show solution');" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="ex1-solution">Show solution</a>
      </div>
      <div id="ex1-solution" class="collapse hide" aria-labelledby="ex1-solution">
          <div class="card-footer">
              The correct answer is "1 is less than 3".
              <br><br>
              3 is less than 4, so the first choice is incorrect. 7 is greater than 5, so the second choice is incorrect. Remember that numbers can be represented by either words or digits, and in this example we are using their digit representations to compare numbers.
          </div>
      </div>
  </div>
  <br><br>

  An important thing to keep in mind is that when we compare two numbers, there are only three possible outcomes:
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li>The first number is greater than the second number. For example, 3 is greater than 0.</li>
    <li>The first number is less than the second number. For example, 1 is less than 5.</li>
    <li>The first number is equal to the second number. For example, 6 is equal to 6.</li>
  </ol>

  Because typing out sentences like these takes too much work, we have invented the following three <b>signs</b> to make it easier to represent these ideas:
  <br><br>
  <table class="table">
      <thead class="thead-light">
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">Sign</th>
          <th scope="col">Name of Sign</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
        <tr>
          <td>\(>\)</td>
          <td>Greater-than sign</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>\(<\)</td>
          <td>Less-than sign</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>\(=\)</td>
          <td>Equals sign</td>
        </tr>
  </table>
  The <b>greater-than sign</b> (\( > \)) is used when the number on the left is greater than the number on the right.<br>
  For example, we write '3 is greater than 0' as \( 3>0 \) using the greater-than sign.
  <br><br>
  The <b>less-than sign</b> (\( < \)) is used when the number on the left is less than the number on the right.<br>
  For example, we write '1 is less than 5' as \( 1<5 \) using the less-than sign.
  <br><br>
  The <b>equals sign</b> (\( = \)) is used when the number on the left is the same as the number on the right.<br>
  For example, we write '6 is equal to 6' as \( 6=6 \) using the equals sign.
  <br><br>
  This little trick might help you tell the greater-than and less-than signs apart:
<b>The pointy end of the sign always points to the smaller number.</b>
<br>
  In the first example \( 3>0 \), 3 is bigger than 0, so the pointy end points to the 0.
  In the second example \( 1<5 \), 1 is smaller than 5, so the pointy end points to the 1.

            The correct answer is \( < \).
            <br><br>
            5 is less than 8, and since the pointy end of the sign always points to the smaller number, the first choice is correct.
