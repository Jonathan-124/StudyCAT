    Imagine that we have a cake in front of us. If we were to cut the cake into two equal halves and eat one of them, how would we use fractions to represent the fraction of cake that we ate?
    Because we cut the cake into 2 halves, the denominator would be the number 2. Because we ate one piece, the numerator would be 1. Therefore, the fraction of cake we ate would be \(\frac{1}{2}\).
    <br><br>
    Now imagine we have the same cake, but instead of cutting it into two halves, we cut it into 4 equally sized pieces. How would we use fractions to represent the proportion of cake that we ate?
    Because we cut the cake into four pieces, the denominator would be the number 4. Because we ate two pieces, the numerator would be 2. Therefore, the fraction of cake we ate would be \(\frac{2}{4}\).
    <br><br>
    If we think about it, in both cases we ate the same amount of cake. Although we cut the cake differently in the two scenarios, the amount of cake that we ended up eating is the same!
    We can therefore come to the interesting conclusion that \(\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}\).
    <br><br>
    Using number lines to think about fractions, this also makes sense. We get to the position of the fraction \(\frac{1}{2}\) by splitting the distance between each adjacent whole number into 2 parts, and counting 1 step from 0 like so:
    <div class="container">
    <figure class="figure">
      <img id="lesson-image-1" class="figure-img img-responsive rounded" style="max-width:70%;">
      <figcaption id="lesson-image-1-caption" class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
    We get to the position of the fraction \(\frac{2}{4}\) by splitting the distance between each adjacent whole number into 4 parts, and counting 2 step from 0 like so:
    <div class="container">
    <figure class="figure">
      <img id="lesson-image-0" class="figure-img img-responsive rounded" style="max-width:70%;">
      <figcaption id="lesson-image-0-caption" class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
    The two fractions are at the same location: exactly halfway between 0 and 1 â€” the two fractions are exactly equivalent (in other words, the same)! In fact, there are many fractions that represent this number. You can verify for yourself that \(\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{6} = \dots = \frac{7541}{15082} = \dots = \frac{40000}{80000} = \cdots\)
    <br><br>
    However, even though these fractions are all equivalent, it is obvious that some fractions (like \(\frac{1}{2}\)) are easier to understand and write down compared to others (like \(\frac{7541}{15082}\)).
    This leads to two questions: How can we get a simpler fraction from a complicated one, and how do we know if two fractions are equivalent??
    <br><br>
    To answer these questions, we need to first talk about <b>simplified fractions</b>. Although there can be many fractions that represent a number, the number can be represented by one and only one simplified fraction. In the example above, \(\frac{1}{2}\) is the only simplified fraction, while all other equivalent fractions \(\frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{6} = \dots = \frac{7541}{15082} = \dots = \frac{40000}{80000} = \cdots\) are not simplified fractions.
    But how do we know if a fraction is a simplified fraction? First, we find the factors of the numerator and denominator. If <i>any</i> factor except for 1 appears in both the numerator and the denominator, the fraction is a simplified fraction. If not, the fraction is not a simplified fraction.
    <br><br>
    For example, let's see if \(\frac{5}{12}\) is a simplified fraction. The factors of the numerator 5 are: 1 and 5. The factors of the denominator are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Because no factor other than 1 is in both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction, it is a simplified fraction.

                Just because both the numerator and the denominator are big numbers <b>does not</b> mean the fraction is not a simplified fraction. However, it does mean finding their factors becomes more difficult.
                The good news is, if we can find <i>any</i> factor except for 1 that is in both the numerator and the denominator, we can say for sure the fraction is not a simplified fraction.
                Because 1052 and 908124 are both divisible by 2, 2 is a factor of both the numerator and the denominator. Therefore, the fraction is not a simplified fraction.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    Furthermore, all fractions can be simplified into an equivalent simplified fraction. For example, the simplified fraction \(\frac{1}{2} =\) is equivalent to the non-simplified fractions \(\frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{40000}{80000} = \frac{7541}{15082} = \dots \).
    One way that we can find the simplified fraction a simple process:
    <ol>
        <li>Try to find a common factor other than 1 in both the numerator and the denominator</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If such a factor exists:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Divide both the numerator and the denominator in the fraction by this factor</li>
                    <li>Repeat from step 1 using this new fraction</li>
                </ol>
            <li>If such a factor does not exist:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>This fraction is a simplified fraction.</li>
                </ol>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <br>
    For example, let's try to simplify the fraction \(\frac{4}{16}\). One common factor of both 4 and 16 is 2, so we divide both the numerator and denominator by 2 to get the new fraction of \(\frac{2}{8}\).
    Repeating from step 1, we find that a common factor of both 2 and 8 is 2, so we divide both the numerator and denominator by 2 to get the new fraction of \(\frac{1}{4}\). 1 and 4 do not have a common factor other than 1, so it is a simplified fraction.
    Note that in the original fraction \(\frac{4}{16}\), a common factor of both the numerator and denominator is 4. We could also have divided the numerator and denominator of this fraction by 4, and it would have gotten us the same result.

                The factors of 9 are 1, 3, 9; the factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, ... but since we only need to find one common factor of 9 and 24, we don't need to find the other factors of 24 after we have found its factor of 3.
                Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3, we get the new fraction \(\frac{3}{8}\).
                To know that a fraction is simplified, we need to make sure no common factor other than 1 exists.
                The factors of 3 are 1 and 3, while the factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8, so no common factor other than 1 exists. Therefore, \(\frac{3}{8} = \frac{9}{24}\), and \(\frac{3}{8}\) is the simplified form of \(\frac{9}{24}\).

    Finally, we can learn how to figure out if two fractions are equivalent. Two fractions are the same number if and only if their simplified forms are the same. In other words, if two fractions have different simplified forms, they are not the same number.
    <br><br>
    For example, let's figure out if \(\frac{2}{3}\) and \(\frac{4}{6}\) are the same. After simplifying both fractions, we can see that both fractions have a simplified form of \(\frac{2}{3}\) (the first fraction is already simplified).
    Because their simplified forms are the same, \(\frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{6}\).
