    Let's begin with an example. If John and Linda has 4 cookies that they wanted to share evenly between them, how many cookies should each person get?
    Using what we've learned so far, we use division to get the answer that each person should get 2 cookies \(4 \div 2 = 2\).
    <br><br>
    What if there were only 3 cookies to split among John and Linda? Using what we've learned so far, we calculate \(3 \div 2 =  1 \cdots 1\).
    In other words, each person gets 1 cookie, and 1 cookie remains. However, you might realize that there is a better way to do it - why don't they just split the last cookie in half, so each person gets one cookie and a half in total?
    <br><br>
    Up until now, we have only dealt with situations involving <b>whole numbers</b>. Like its name, whole numbers are numbers that represent "whole" amounts of things, whether it be cookies, or apples, t-shirts or books.
    However, in situations like the above example, we see that there are situations where whole numbers are not enough - we need a way to represent parts of what we are counting that are smaller than each individual unit.
    <br><br>
    Visually on the number line, each whole number is a distance of 1 away from the next whole number. What we are trying to represent are numbers <i>between</i> whole numbers.
    In the example, when we try to split 3 cookies into 2 equal portions, the answer of one and a half cookies is exactly halfway between the whole numbers 1 and 2.

    <b>Fractions</b> and <b>mixed numbers</b> are two ways to do represent these "non-whole" numbers.
    <br><br>
    A fraction, just like its name indicates, is a number that represents a fraction of a whole. It always has a horizontal line in between two whole numbers above and below it, like so.
    $$\dfrac{3}{4}$$
    The number below the line is called the <b>denominator</b>. It represents the number of pieces we are dividing each unit into.
    The number above the line is called the <b>numerator</b>. It represents the number of pieces we are counting.
    <br><br>
    For example, let's say we cut a cake evenly into 4 slices, and take 3 slices. How much cake do we have?
    Because the 3 slices are less than one whole cake, we have to use fractions instead of whole numbers. Because we are equally dividing the cake into 4 slices, the denominator is 4. Because we have 3 slices, the numerator is 3.
    The fraction \(\frac{3}{4}\) therefore represents the amount of cake we have.

                The correct answer is \(\frac{5}{8}\) pizzas.
                <br><br>
                Since Ricky did not eat the whole pizza, we use fractions to represent how much pizza he ate. The pizza is cut into 8 pieces, so the denominator is 8. Because Ricky ate 5 pieces of the whole pizza, the numerator is 5.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    Fractions can be further classified as proper or improper fractions.
    A <b>proper fraction</b> is a fraction with a numerator less than its denominator. For example, \(\frac{5}{8}\) is a proper fraction. Proper fractions are always less than 1, as the number of pieces we are counting are less than the number of pieces we are splitting each unit into.
    <br><br>
    An <b>improper fraction</b> is a fraction with a numerator greater than its denominator. For example, in the cookies example we split each cookie into 2 equal pieces, and gave each person 3 pieces. Each person therefore has \(\frac{3}{2}\) cookies, where \(\frac{3}{2}\) is an improper fraction because \(3>2\).
    Improper fractions are always greater than 1, as the number of pieces we are counting are more than the number of pieces we are splitting each unit into.
    <br><br>
    On the number line, we can find the location of any fraction by splitting the distance between each adjacent whole number into the denominator number of parts, and counting the numerator number of steps from 0.
    For example, the proper fraction \(\frac{3}{8}\) can be found by splitting the distance between each adjacent whole number into 8 parts, and counting 3 steps from 0 like so:
    <div class="container">
    <figure class="figure">
      <img id="lesson-image-1" class="figure-img img-responsive rounded" style="max-width:70%;">
      <figcaption id="lesson-image-1-caption" class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
    For example, the improper fraction \(\frac{3}{2}\) can be found by splitting the distance between each adjacent whole number into 2 parts, and counting 3 steps from 0 like so:
    <div class="container">
    <figure class="figure">
      <img id="lesson-image-2" class="figure-img img-responsive rounded" style="max-width:70%;">
      <figcaption id="lesson-image-2-caption" class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <b>Mixed numbers</b> are another way of representing improper fractions. A mixed number consists of two parts: a whole number on the left, and a proper fraction on the right. For example, \(2 \frac{1}{3}\) is a mixed number.
    The whole number in a mixed number indicates the amount of "whole" things we are measuring, and the fraction represents the amount of "pieces" we have.
    In the cookies example, each person has one and a half cookies. To represent this using mixed numbers, the whole number on the left is is the amount of "whole" cookies (\(1\)), and the fraction on the right is the amount of "pieces" there are (\(\frac{1}{2}\)). \(1 \frac{1}{2}\) is therefore the mixed number that represents the concept of one and a half.
    <br><br>
    On the number line, we can find the location of any mixed number by splitting the distance between each adjacent whole number into the denominator number of parts, locating the position of the whole number, and counting the numerator number of steps from the whole number.
    For example, the mixed number \(2\frac{1}{3}\) can be found by first, splitting the distance between each adjacent whole number into 3 parts, locating the whole number 2, then counting 1 step to the right like so:

                The correct answer is \(\frac{11}{8}\) pizzas (improper fraction) or \(1 \frac{3}{8}\) pizzas (mixed number).
                <br><br>
                Let's first represent the number using an improper fraction. A pizza is cut into 8 pieces, so the denominator is 8. Because Ricky ate 11 pieces in total, the numerator is 11, giving the improper fraction of \(\frac{11}{8}\).<br>
                We can also represent the same number using a mixed number. The 11 slices that Sam eats can be thought of 1 whole pizza plus 3 extra slices. The whole number in the mixed number is therefore 1, and the fraction part is \(\frac{3}{8}\).
