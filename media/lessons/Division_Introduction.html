Let's start with an example. If we had eight cookies in total, and wanted to split the cookies evenly between two people, how many cookies would each person get?
It's not too difficult to figure out that each of the two people would get four cookies.
<br><br>
In short, we have performed <b>division</b>!
When we have a number of things (cookies in this case) that we want to evenly split into some number of groups, we <b>divide</b> the total number by the number of groups we want to get how many things are in each group.
<br><br>
In other words, we split the total number of things we have evenly into a number of groups. The number of things in each group is the result of the total number divided by the number of groups we have.
<br><br>
To rephrase what we did in the example more simply, we could say '8 divided by 4'.
Because writing 'divide' becomes tiring after a while, we use the symbol \( \div \) (called a <b>division sign</b>) instead to write it as
$$ 8 \div 2 $$
Since the result of \( 8 \div 2 \) is equal to 4, we can also write
$$ 8 \div 2=4 $$
<br><br>
As an aside, the number in front of the division sign (the total number of things we are dividing) is called the <b>dividend</b>, and the number after the division sign (the number of groups we are dividing the things into) is called the <b>divisor</b>. The result of division (the number on the right of the equals sign) is also called the <b>quotient</b>. In this example, we say the quotient of 8 divided by 2 is 4.

Let's go through some exercises.

<div class="card">
    <div class="card-header">
        <h5>Exercise 1</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
        <p>Fill in the blank. $$ 6 \div 3 = \square$$</p>
        <br>
        <a class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" href="#ex1-solution" onclick="this.innerHTML = (this.innerHTML == 'Show solution' ? 'Hide solution' : 'Show solution');" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="ex1-solution">Show solution</a>
    </div>
    <div id="ex1-solution" class="collapse hide" aria-labelledby="ex1-solution">
        <div class="card-footer">
            The correct answer is \( 2 \).
            <br><br>
            We want to see how many things are in each group after we evenly split 6 total things into 3 groups.<br>
            Because there are 2 things in each group, the quotient of \( 6 \div 3 \) is 2.
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <div class="card-header">
        <h5>Exercise 2</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
        <p>Ryan, Anna, and Josh bought 12 cupcakes in total, and want to split the cupcakes evenly among them. How many cupcakes should each person get?</p>
        <br>
        <a class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" href="#ex2-solution" onclick="this.innerHTML = (this.innerHTML == 'Show solution' ? 'Hide solution' : 'Show solution');" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="ex2-solution">Show solution</a>
    </div>
    <div id="ex2-solution" class="collapse hide" aria-labelledby="ex2-solution">
        <div class="card-footer">
            The correct answer is 4.
            <br><br>
            There are 12 cupcakes in total, and since we want to split it among 3 people equally, we need to divide the numbers (\( 12 \div 3 \)).
            The result of \( 12 \div 3 \) is 4, which is the number of cupcakes each person should get after equally divvying them up.
        </div>
    </div>

To summarize division:
<ul>
  <li>Division calculates how many things are each group after evenly splitting a number of things into groups</li>
  <li>Division is represented by the division sign (\( \div \))</li>
  <li>The result of division is called the quotient</li>
  <li>The number in front of the division sign (the dividend) is the total number of things there are, and the number after the division sign (the divisor) is the number of groups we are dividing them into</li>
</ul>
