    Recall that we use exponents (also known as powers) to denote a number multiplied by itself many times.
    \(2^3\) (two to the power of three) is an example of an exponent, which can be simplified into \(2^3 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8\).
    <br><br>
    <b>Radicals</b> (also known as <b>roots</b>) are closely related to exponents — radicals are operations that "undo" exponents.
    A radical usually has three parts: a radical/root sign (\(\sqrt{ \ \ \ }\)), a number underneath the radical sign, and a small number to the left of the radical sign (called the index) like so:
    $$\sqrt[3]{8}$$.
    In this example, 8 is the number under the radical sign, and 3 is the index.
    <br><br>
    Although it looks complicated, every radical asks a simple question: what is the number(s) that, when multiplied to itself the index number of times, will give an answer equal to the number under the radical sign?
    In other words, the radical asks us to find all numbers that, after raising it to the power of the index, will give us the number underneath the radical sign.
    <br><br>
    For example, the radical \(\sqrt[3]{64}\) asks us to find all numbers that, when multiplied to itself 3 times, will equal to 64. 4 is the only number that fits the criteria, therefore \(\sqrt[3]{64} = 4\).

                The radical is asking what number, when raised to the power of 5, gives the answer of 32. 2 is the only number that fits the criteria, therefore \(\sqrt[5]{32} = 2\).<br>

    Sometimes, there might be more than one answer to a radical. For example, the radical \(\sqrt[4]{16}\) has two answers, \(2\) and \(-2\). This is because \(2^4 = 16\) and \((-2)^4 = 16\), so both answers satisfy the required conditions.

    The most common index we see with radicals is 2. We even have a special name for when we have a radical with an index of 2 — taking the square root.
    Because how common it is to have an index of 2 when taking a radical, instead of writing \(\sqrt[2]{ \ \ \ }\), we usually omit the index when it is 2 and only write the radical sign, \(\sqrt{ \ \ \ }\).
    <br><br>
    For example, we usually write \(\sqrt{9}\) instead of \(\sqrt[2]{9}\). The other aspects of calculating the radical is the same: both \(3^2\) and \((-3)^2\) are equal to 9, therefore \(\sqrt{9} = 3, -3\).

    Unlike all the previous operations we have learned (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents), there might be more than one answer for one radical, and the answer is more difficult to compute.
    Fortunately, there is a handy trick we can use to determine exactly how many answers there are:
    <ul>
        <li>If the index of the radical is an odd number (in other words, it is not divisible by 2):</li>
        <ul>
            <li>There will be exactly one single solution to the radical, and it will have the same sign as the number underneath the radical symbol.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>If the index of the radical is an even number (in other words, it is not divisible by 2):</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If the number underneath the radical is negative, there will be no solutions to the radical.</li>
            <li>If the number underneath the radical is positive, there will be exactly two solutions to the radical. These two solutions will always be the positive and negative versions of the same number.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    Here's an illustration: let's say we want to evaluate \(\sqrt[3]{-8}\). Because the index 3 is an odd number, we know that there is only one solution. Because the number underneath the radical symbol, -8, is negative, we know that the solution must also be a negative number.
    Knowing this restricts our search area by a lot, and we can easily figure out \(\sqrt[3]{-8} = -2\).
