    Imagine that we have a cake in front of us. If we were to cut the cake into two equal halves and eat one of the halves, how would we use fractions to represent the fraction of cake that we ate?
    Because we cut the cake into 2 halves, the denominator is 2. Because we ate one piece, the numerator is 1. Therefore, the fraction of cake we ate is \(\frac{1}{2}\).
    <br><br>
    Now imagine we have the same cake, but instead of cutting it into two halves, we cut it into 4 equally sized pieces. How would we use fractions to represent the proportion of cake that we ate?
    Because we cut the cake into four pieces, the denominator is 4. Because we ate two pieces, the numerator is 2. Therefore, the fraction of cake we ate is \(\frac{2}{4}\).
    <br><br>
    If we think about it, in both cases we ate the same amount of cake. Although we cut the cake differently in the two scenarios, the amount of cake that we ended up eating is the same!
    We can therefore come to the interesting conclusion that \(\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}\).
    <br><br>
    Using number lines to think about fractions, this also makes sense. We get to the position of the fraction \(\frac{1}{2}\) by splitting the distance between each adjacent whole number into 2 parts, and counting 1 step from 0 like so:
    <div class="container">
    <figure class="figure">
      <img id="lesson-image-0" class="figure-img img-responsive rounded" style="max-width:70%;">
      <figcaption id="lesson-image-0-caption" class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

      <img id="lesson-image-1" class="figure-img img-responsive rounded" style="max-width:70%;">

    The two fractions are at the same location: exactly halfway between 0 and 1 â€” the two fractions are exactly <b>equivalent</b> (in other words, the same)! In fact, there are many fractions that represent this number. You can verify for yourself that \(\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{7541}{15082} = \frac{40000}{80000} = \cdots\).
    <br><br>
    The general rule is: <b>if you multiply or divide a fraction's numerator and denominator by the same number, you will always get an equivalent fraction.</b>
    <br><br>
    Why is this the case? Think of it this way: if we cut a cake into 2 equal slices and take 1 piece (\(\frac{1}{2}\)), it is the same as cutting it into 4 equal slices and taking 2 pieces (\(\frac{1 \times 2}{2 \times 2}=\frac{2}{4}\)), or cutting it into 6 equal slices and taking 3 pieces (\(\frac{1 \times 3}{2 \times 3}=\frac{3}{6}\)), or cutting it into 15082 equal slices and taking 7541 pieces (\(\frac{1 \times 7541}{2 \times 7541}=\frac{7541}{15802}\))...

                We do not know the denominator of the fraction on the right, but we can solve for the answer because the two fractions are equivalent. The numerator of the right fraction (2) is the numerator of the left (8) divided by 4.
                Because the two fractions are equal, we know that the denominator of the fraction on the right must be the denominator of the left fraction (12) divided by the same number that the numerators were divided by - 4. \(12 \div 4=3\), therefore \(\frac{8}{12} = \frac{2}{3}\).

    However, even though many fractions can be equivalent to each other, it is obvious that some fractions (like \(\frac{1}{2}\)) are easier to understand and write down compared to others (like \(\frac{7541}{15082}\)).
    Although there can be many fractions that represent a number, the number can be represented by one and only one <b>simplified fraction</b>. In the example above, \(\frac{1}{2}\) is the only simplified fraction, while all other equivalent fractions \(\frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{7541}{15082} = \frac{40000}{80000} = \cdots\) are not simplified fractions.

    We can tell if a fraction is a simplified fraction in one simple step: if <i>any</i> factor except for 1 appears in both the numerator and the denominator, the fraction is a simplified fraction. If not, the fraction is not a simplified fraction.
    <br><br>
    For example, let's see if \(\frac{5}{12}\) is a simplified fraction. The factors of the numerator 5 are: 1 and 5. The factors of the denominator are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Because no factor other than 1 is in both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction, it is a simplified fraction.

                Just because both the numerator and the denominator are big numbers <b>does not</b> mean the fraction is not a simplified fraction. However, it does mean finding their factors becomes more difficult.
                The good news is, if we can find <i>any</i> factor except for 1 that is in both the numerator and the denominator, we can say for sure the fraction is not a simplified fraction.
                Because 1052 and 908124 are both divisible by 2, 2 is a factor of both the numerator and the denominator. Therefore, the fraction is not a simplified fraction.

    We can find the simplified fraction of any fraction with a simple process:
    <ol>
        <li>Try to find a common factor other than 1 in both the numerator and the denominator</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If such a factor exists:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Divide both the numerator and the denominator in the fraction by this factor</li>
                    <li>Repeat from step 1 using this new fraction</li>
                </ol>
            <li>If such a factor does not exist:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>This fraction is a simplified fraction.</li>
                </ol>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <br>
    For example, let's try to simplify the fraction \(\frac{4}{16}\). One common factor of both 4 and 16 is 2, so we divide both the numerator and denominator by 2 to get the new fraction of \(\frac{2}{8}\).
    Repeating from step 1, we find that a common factor of both 2 and 8 is 2, so we divide both the numerator and denominator by 2 to get the new fraction of \(\frac{1}{4}\). 1 and 4 do not have a common factor other than 1, so it is a simplified fraction.
    Note that in the original fraction \(\frac{4}{16}\), a common factor of both the numerator and denominator is 4. We could also have divided the numerator and denominator of this fraction by 4, and it would have gotten us the same result.

                The factors of 9 are 1, 3, 9; the factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, ... but since we only need to find one common factor of 9 and 24, we don't need to find the other factors of 24 after we have found its factor of 3.
                Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3, we get the new fraction \(\frac{3}{8}\).
                To know that a fraction is simplified, we need to make sure no common factor other than 1 exists.
                The factors of 3 are 1 and 3, while the factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8, so no common factor other than 1 exists. Therefore, \(\frac{3}{8} = \frac{9}{24}\), and \(\frac{3}{8}\) is the simplified form of \(\frac{9}{24}\).
