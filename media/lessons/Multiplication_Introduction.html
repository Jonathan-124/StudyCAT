    Let's start with a question. How many squares are there below?
    $$
    \begin{matrix}
    &\square&\square&\square&\square&\square&\square&\square \\
    &\square&\square&\square&\square&\square&\square&\square \\
    &\square&\square&\square&\square&\square&\square&\square \\
    &\square&\square&\square&\square&\square&\square&\square \\
    &\square&\square&\square&\square&\square&\square&\square \\
    &\square&\square&\square&\square&\square&\square&\square \\
    \end{matrix}
    $$
    One way to do this is to count the squares one by one, and we can figure out that there are 42 squares in total.
    However, this is a very inefficient way of solving the problem. Even for such a short problem, it already takes a lot of time to count the number of squares.
    <br><br>
    You might notice that the squares are arranged very nicely. There are 7 columns in total, and each column has exactly 6 squares.
    A slightly simpler way to count the total number of squares is, instead of counting one square at a time, we count one column at a time!
    In this example, each column has 6 squares, and since there are 7 columns in total, we count by six seven times (\( 6+6+6+6+6+6+6 \)) to get the answer of 42!
    <br><br>
    There is an even simpler way to represent the addition of a number to itself, over and over again â€” <b>multiplication</b>!
    To rephrase what we did in the example more simply, we could say '6 multiplied by 7', which is another way to say 'add 6 to itself 7 times'.
    <br><br>
    Because writing 'multiply' becomes tiresome after a while, we use the symbol \( \times \) (called a <b>multiplication sign</b>) instead to write it as
    $$ 6 \times 7 $$
    Since the result of \( 6 \times 7 \) is equal to 42, we can also write
    $$ 6 \times 7 = 42 $$
    The result of multiplication (the number on the right of the equals sign) is also called the <b>product</b>. In this example, we say the product of 6 and 7 is 42.
    <br><br>
    Notice that in this example, you can also count the total number of squares one row at a time instead of counting one column at a time!<br>
    There are 7 squares in each row, and 6 rows in total. Adding 7 to itself 6 times (\(7+7+7+7+7+7\)) is the same as saying 7 multiplied by 6 (\( 7 \times 6 =42 \)), which also gives us the total number of squares.
    <br><br>
    In other words, <b>order of multiplication does not matter</b>. You can always switch the order of the two numbers that you are multiplying, and still get the same product.

    Let's go through some exercises.
    <br><br>
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-header">
            <h5>Exercise 1</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>Fill in the blank. $$ 3 \times 8 = \square$$</p>
            <br>
            <a class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" href="#ex1-solution" onclick="this.innerHTML = (this.innerHTML == 'Show solution' ? 'Hide solution' : 'Show solution');" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="ex1-solution">Show solution</a>
        </div>
        <div id="ex1-solution" class="collapse hide" aria-labelledby="ex1-solution">
            <div class="card-footer">
                The correct answer is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \).
                <br><br>
                We add 3 to itself 8 times, and get the product of 24. Recall that since order of multiplication does not matter, we can add 8 to itself 3 times (\( 8 \times 3 \)) and get the same answer.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <br><br>
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-header">
            <h5>Exercise 2</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>Charlie has 4 boxes, and each box has 6 cookies. How many cookies does charlie have in total?</p>
            <br>
            <a class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" href="#ex2-solution" onclick="this.innerHTML = (this.innerHTML == 'Show solution' ? 'Hide solution' : 'Show solution');" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="ex2-solution">Show solution</a>
        </div>
        <div id="ex2-solution" class="collapse hide" aria-labelledby="ex2-solution">
            <div class="card-footer">
                The correct answer is 24.
                <br><br>
                To find the total number of cookies Charlie has, we need to add the number of cookies in each box to itself 4 times. \( 6 \times 4 = 24\), so there are 24 cookies in total.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    A final useful concept that you might have encountered is <b>multiples</b>. A multiple of a number is any number that is the product of the original number multiplied by another. <br>
    For example, 3, 6, 9 are all multiples of 3, as \(3 \times 1=3\), \(3 \times 2=6\), and \(3 \times 3=9\). 4 is not a multiple of 3, as there is no number that can go in the blank \(3 \times \square =4\).

                The correct answer is \( 1 \).

                \( 2 \times 1=2\), \( 2 \times 2=4\), and \( 2 \times 4=8\). Since there is no number to put in the blank in \( 2 \times \square=1\), 1 is not a multple of 2.
