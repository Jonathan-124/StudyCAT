    Congratulations! We have learned about the four elementary operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)!
    Before we move on to the next big topic, let's add a necessary tool into our arsenal â€” the <b>number line</b>.
    <br><br>
    So far, we have learned that numbers have different "sizes". In other words, a number can be bigger than, smaller than, or equal to another number.
    For example, when comparing the two numbers \(2\) and \(3\), we say \(2\) is less than \(3\) because the number \(2\) represents fewer things than the number \(3\), and therefore \(2 < 3\).
    Consider another example, where we compare the numbers \(2\) and \(100\). By the same reasoning as above, \(2 < 100\).
    However, it seems like even though \(2 < 3\) and \(2 < 100\) are true statements, the difference between 2 and 3 is a lot less than the difference between 2 and 100.
    To visually show how much a number is greater/smaller than another number, we use a <b>number line</b>.
    <br>
    <div class="container">
    <figure class="figure">
      <img id="lesson-image-0" class="figure-img img-responsive rounded" style="max-width:50%;">
      <figcaption id="lesson-image-0-caption" class="figure-caption"></figcaption>

    All number lines have the following two properties:
    <ul>
        <li>Smaller numbers are always on the left of larger numbers</li>
        <li>The difference between any two numbers is equal to the <b>distance</b> between them</li>
    </ul>
    Using these two fascinating properties, the number line offers us a different, more in-depth interpretation of the four elementary operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

    <br><br>
    When we add two numbers, we start at the first number, then go to the right the <i>distance</i> of the second number to get the sum.<br>
    For example, when we calculate \(3+5\), we start from 3 and then take 5 steps to the right to get the sum of 8.
    <div class="container">
    <figure class="figure">
      <img id="lesson-image-1" class="figure-img img-responsive rounded" style="max-width:50%;">
      <figcaption id="lesson-image-1-caption" class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    When we subtract two numbers, we start at the first number, then go to the left <i>distance</i> of the second number to get the difference.<br>
    For example, when we calculate \(10-2\), we start from 10 and then take 2 steps to the left to get the difference of 8.
    <div class="container">
    <figure class="figure">
      <img id="lesson-image-2" class="figure-img img-responsive rounded" style="max-width:50%;">
      <figcaption id="lesson-image-2-caption" class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    When we multiply two numbers, their product is the number we arrive at after walking to the right the <i>distance</i> of the first number, for a total of the second number number of times.<br>
    For example, when we calculate \(2 \times 3 \), we can find the answer of 6 on the number line by walking to the right a distance of 2 for a total of 3 times.
    <div class="container">
    <figure class="figure">
      <img id="lesson-image-3" class="figure-img img-responsive rounded" style="max-width:50%;">
      <figcaption id="lesson-image-3-caption" class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    When we divide two numbers, their quotient is the number we arrive at after splitting the <i>distance</i> to the dividend evenly into the divisor number of sections, then walking to the closest "split" from 0.<br>
    For example, when we calculate \(6 \div 3 \), we evenly split the distance between 0 to 6 into 3 parts. The answer is the closest "split" to 0, which is at 2.

    What we are doing here is often very confusing for first time learners, because it almost seems like what we are doing here are not at all related to the ideas of adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing.
    However, a closer look tells us that the number line is merely a different way of thinking about these operations we all know and love. Take subtraction for example. Originally we have used subtraction to solve problems where a number of things had been taken away from the total.
    The number line "version" of subtraction deals with the same thing, by first "walking right" to the total number, then "walking left" to take away a number of things, which is the same concept but represented differently.
