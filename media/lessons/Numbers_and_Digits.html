    <b>Numbers</b> are what we use to count and measure things.
    <br><br>
    For example, I can say that I have three cookies.
    In this example, the word "three" is a number that I use to count the number of cookies I have.
    I can also say that I see three people.
    In this example, the word "three" is a number that I use to count the number of people I see.
    In the first case, it measures the amount of cookies I have. In the second case, it measures the amount of people there are.
    Notice how even though the things we are counting are different, the numbers used to describe them are the same because the amount is the same!

    Although words like "three" can be used to represent numbers, we usually represent numbers in a more efficient way, as shown in this table.
    The column on the left are words associated with these numbers, and the column on the right are <b>digits</b>, which are unique symbols we use to represent these numbers instead of words.
