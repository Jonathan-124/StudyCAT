    <b>Decimal numbers</b> are used to represent non-whole numbers. In other words, we use decimal numbers as one way to indicate numbers "between" whole numbers on the number line.
    Decimal numbers always have a single <b>decimal point</b> and at least one digit.
    <br><br>
    For example, you might have seen products with a price of $4.99 in supermarkets. The number 4.99 consists of three digits and one decimal point, and is therefore a decimal number. A price of $4.99 is more than 4 dollars but less than 5 dollars â€” the number 4.99 is somewhere on the number line between the whole numbers 4 and 5.

    Before we talk about the specifics of decimal numbers, we need to do a little review on place value.
    Recall that in whole numbers with any number of digits, we always assign place to digits from right to left. In other words, we start from the digit in the right-most position, then proceed to the left one place at a time.
    Here is a table of how we assign place for numbers up to a million.
    <br><br>
    <table class="table">
    <thead class="thead-light">
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">Position</th>
        <th scope="col">Place</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
      <tr>
        <td>Right-most place</td>
        <td>Ones' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Second place from the right</td>
        <td>Tens' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Third place from the right</td>
        <td>Hundreds' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Fourth place from the right</td>
        <td>Thousands' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Fifth place from the right</td>
        <td>Ten-thousands' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Sixth place from the right</td>
        <td>Hundred-thousands' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Seventh from the right</td>
        <td>Millions' place</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    For example, the number 234 has a 2 in the hundreds' place, a 3 in the tens' place, and a 4 in the ones' place. It means that the number 234 consists of 2 groups of "one hundred", 3 groups of "ten", and 4 groups of "one" (\(234=200+30+4\)).
    <br><br>
    With decimal numbers, we extend our definition of places so that we can talk about numbers that are not whole numbers.
    With decimal numbers, we define each place in relation to the <b>decimal point</b>. The places on the left side of the decimal point are the same as the places we have defined for whole numbers. The ones place is the place directly to the left of the decimal point, the tens place is two places to the left of the decimal point, etc.
    The places on the right side of the decimal point are used to indicate quantities smaller than a whole number.
    Here is a table of how we assign place for some decimal numbers:
    <br><br>
    <table class="table">
    <thead class="thead-light">
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">Position</th>
        <th scope="col">Place</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
      <tr>
        <td>Third place to the right of the decimal point</td>
        <td><i>Thousandths</i> place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Second place to the right of the decimal point</td>
        <td><i>Hundredths</i> place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Place directly to the right of the decimal point</td>
        <td><i>Tenths</i> place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Place directly left of the decimal point</td>
        <td>Ones' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Second place to the left of the decimal point</td>
        <td>Tens' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Third place to the left of the decimal point</td>
        <td>Hundreds' place</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br><br>
    For example, the number 234.56 has a 2 in the hundreds' place, a 3 in the tens' place, a 4 in the ones' place, a 5 in the tenths place, and a 6 in the hundredths place.
    It means that the number 234 consists of 2 groups of "one hundred", 3 groups of "ten", 4 groups of "one", 5 groups of "one tenth", and 6 groups of "one hundredth" (\(234.56=200+30+4+0.5+0.06\)).

              The correct answer is "Hundredth place".
              <br><br>
              The number is a decimal number, and the digit 6 occupies the place 2 spots to the right of the decimal point, which is the hundredths place.
              Note that this is not the Hundreds place, which is three spots to the left of the decimal point and is occupied by the digit 1.

              The correct answer is 6.
              <br><br>
              Using the table above, we know that the tenths place is the place directly to the right of the decimal point. The digit 6 occupies this place, so the tenths place in 0.6518 has a place value of 6.

    To better show why we we use decimal numbers, here's a visualization. Below is a number line with the locations of 0 and 10 marked.
    <div class="container">
    <figure class="figure">
      <img id="lesson-image-1" class="figure-img img-responsive rounded" style="max-width:70%;">
      <figcaption id="lesson-image-1-caption" class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
    If we were to split the length between 0 and 10 into ten segments of equal distances and label these spots on the number line, we would get a number line like this:
    <div class="container">
    <figure class="figure">
      <img id="lesson-image-2" class="figure-img img-responsive rounded" style="max-width:70%;">
      <figcaption id="lesson-image-2-caption" class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
    This is because the difference between any two numbers is equal to the distance between them on the number line, and the original number line had a distance of 10 between 0 and 10.
    Now that we split the distance into 10 equal segments, the distance between each number becomes exactly 1.
    <br><br>
    Now, below is a new zoomed in number line with the locations of 0 and 1 marked.
    <div class="container">
    <figure class="figure">
      <img id="lesson-image-3" class="figure-img img-responsive rounded" style="max-width:70%;">
      <figcaption id="lesson-image-3-caption" class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
    If we were to split the length between 0 and 1 into ten segments of equal distances and label the number line, we would get a number line like this:
    <div class="container">
    <figure class="figure">
      <img id="lesson-image-4" class="figure-img img-responsive rounded" style="max-width:70%;">
