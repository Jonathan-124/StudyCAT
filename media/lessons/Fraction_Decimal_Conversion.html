    Since we can use both fractions and decimals to represent non-whole numbers, it makes sense that the same number can be represented as both a fraction and a decimal.
    For example, the fraction \(\frac{3}{2}\) and the decimal \(1.5\) are the same number, and are at the same location on the number line.
    The question we want to answer in this lesson is, how do we convert a fraction to a decimal and vice versa?
    <br><br>
    Before we talk about fraction/decimal conversions, we need to delve a bit deeper into the meaning of fractions.
    When we introduced fractions, we said that the denominator of a fraction represents how many equal "pieces" we are splitting each unit into, while the numerator represents how many of these units we are counting.
    For example, if we had \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a candy bar, the denominator 3 represents the number of equal pieces each candy bar is divided into, and the numerator 2 represents the number of pieces we are counting.
    <br><br>
    Another way to think about fractions is to think of fractions as the equivalent of division. The numerator is the dividend, and the denominator is the divisor. In fact, the division sign \(\div \) actually represents a fraction, where the dots on the top/bottom represent the numerator/denominator respectively!
    For example, if we had 2 candy bars and wanted to divide them equally into 3 pieces, each piece would have the size of \(2 \div 3 = \frac{2}{3}\) of a candy bar.
    <br><br>
    These two ways of thinking about fractions are actually equivalent, and any fraction can be thought of in both ways.
    For example, let's try to think about where the fraction \(\frac{2}{3}\) lies on the number line.
    Using the first method, we split the distances between adjacent whole numbers into 3 equal segments, and count a total of 2 segments to get to the fraction \(\frac{2}{3}\).
    <br>
    <div class="container">
    <figure class="figure">
      <img id="lesson-image-0" class="figure-img img-responsive rounded" style="max-width:70%;">
      <figcaption id="lesson-image-0-caption" class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
    <br>
    Using the second method, we split the distance from 0 to 2 into 3 equal sections, and the length of each section is equal to the fraction \(\frac{2}{3}\).
    <div class="container">
    <figure class="figure">
      <img id="lesson-image-1" class="figure-img img-responsive rounded" style="max-width:70%;">
      <figcaption id="lesson-image-1-caption" class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
    <br>
    These two ways of thinking about fractions are useful in different situations, and the second way of thinking is more useful for converting fractions to decimals.
    The process of converting a fraction to a decimal is simple: we simply divide the numerator by the denominator!
    <br><br>
    Recall that previously when we tried to divide a number by a divisor that is not its factor, we had to find a remainder since the numbers were not divisible.
    For example, we said that \(10 \div 3 = 3 \cdots 1\), where 3 is the quotient and 1 is the remainder.
    However, when we use fractions to represent non-whole numbers, we need to evenly divide numbers such as \(10 \div 3\) without remainders to convert a fraction to a decimal.
    <br><br>
    Let's try an example: convert \(\frac{3}{4}\) into a decimal.
    \(\frac{3}{4} = 3 \div 4\), so we have to divide 3 by 4. Although it might seem like 3 is indivisible by 4, recall that when it seems like the dividend is too big and cannot be divided by the divisor, we can find an equivalent dividend with trailing zeroes added.
    \(\frac{3}{4} = 3 \div 4 = 3.00 \div 4\), which we can compute using the decimal division techniques which we have learned.
    $$
    \begin{matrix}
    \ \ \ \ \ 0.75 \\
     4 \ \overline{)3.00} \\
    -2 \ 8\\ \hline
    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  20 \\
    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  20 \\ \hline
    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0
    \end{matrix}
    $$
    \(\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\), and we have converted a fraction into a decimal!

    To convert decimals to fractions, we use a similar trick when we convert whole numbers to fractions.
    Recall that any number can be as a fraction with the number as the numerator and 1 as the denominator.
    For example, the number 3 can be expressed as the fraction \(\frac{3}{1}\).
    <br><br>
    The same is true for decimals. For example, the decimal 1.2 can be expressed as the fraction \(\frac{1.2}{1}\).
    However, because we usually only have whole numbers as numerators and denominators, we need to find an equivalent fraction of \(\frac{1.2}{1}\) that does not have a decimal number as the numerator or denominator.
    To do so, we need to multiply both the numerator and denominator by the same number that makes both the numerator and denominator whole numbers.
    <br><br>
    For example, convert the decimal 1.2 into a true fraction, we first express it as a fraction, \(1.2 = \frac{1.2}{1}\).
    The multiples of 1.2 are 1.2, 2.4, 3.6, 4.8, 6,... Since 6 is a whole number, and \(1.2 \times 5 = 6\), \(\frac{1.2}{1} = \frac{1.2 \times 5}{1 \times 5} = \frac{6}{5}\).
    Therefore, the decimal 1.2 is the same as the simplified fraction \(\frac{6}{5}\).

                \( 0.4 = \frac{0.4}{1}\).
                The multiples of 0.4 are 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2,... Since 2 is a whole number, and \(0.4 \times 5 = 2\), \(\frac{0.4}{1} = \frac{0.4 \times 5}{1 \times 5} = \frac{2}{5}\).
            </div>

    One thing to note is that the same decimal number can be converted to many equivalent fractions.
    For example, the decimal number 0.5 is equal to the fractions \(\frac{1}{2}\), \(\frac{2}{4}\), \(\frac{3}{6}\), etc.
    Usually when we convert a decimal to a fraction we convert it to the simplified fraction, but it's good to keep in mind that there are other correct answers as well.

                We can convert the four fractions into their equivalent decimal numbers, and see which fraction does not equal 0.25.
                \(\frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{3}{12} = 0.25\), but \(\frac{4}{20} = 0.2\), therefore the fourth choice is correct.

    There are cases when it is not easy to convert simple decimals to fractions.
    For example, a relatively simple decimal 0.1234 has an equivalent fraction \(\frac{617}{5000}\), which is already in its simplified form!
    In this case, it is very difficult to realize that 617 is the lowest whole number multiple of 0.1234.
    <br><br>
    There are also cases when it is not easy to convert simple fractions to decimals.
    For example, a very simple fraction \(\frac{1}{7}\) has an equivalent decimal of 0.142857142815142857..., a repeating decimal number!
    In this case, trying to convert \(\frac{1}{7}\) by calculating \(1 \div 7\) is very tedious, and gives a never ending, repeating decimal number.
    <br><br>
    Sometimes simple decimals cannot be converted to simple fractions and vice versa, and this is one of the reasons why we use both decimals and fractions to describe non-whole numbers — sometimes it is easier to use decimals, and sometimes it is easier to use fractions.
