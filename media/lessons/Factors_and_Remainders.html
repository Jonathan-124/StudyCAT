    Let's try to solve another question of division. Imagine there are 3 people in a room with 15 books in total. If we want to split the books evenly among everyone in the room, how many books should each person get?<br>
    Because there are 15 books in total to be split among 3 people, the number of books that each person should get is \( 15 \div 3 = 5\).
    <br><br>
    However, what if there were 16 books instead of 15? How many books should each person get? Is there a way to split all the books evenly?<br>
    Unfortunately, there is no way to split the 16 books evenly among 5 people. The best we could do is to give everyone 5 books, but there will be 1 book remaining at the end.
    <br><br>
    There are many problems like these in real life, where it is not possible to exactly divide two numbers.<br>
    One important question to ask is: when is a number <b>divisible</b> by another number? In other words, when can a number be exactly divided by another?<br>
    To help us understand which circumstances two numbers are divisible, we need to talk a little about <b>remainders</b> and <b>factors</b>, two tools that will help us solve this puzzle!
    <br><br>
    When dividing two numbers, the <b>remainder</b> is the remaining number that cannot be further evenly divided.<br>
    In the second part of the example above, the remainder of \( 16 \div 3 \) is 1, as after dividing 16 books evenly into 3 groups of 5, there is still 1 remaining that cannot be evenly divided.
    In the first part of the example above, the remainder of \( 15 \div 3 \) is 0, as after dividing 15 books evenly into 3 groups of 5, are no books remaining.
    <br>
    Usually if there is a remainder after division, we write three dots to the right of the answer followed by the remainder, like so:
    $$16 \div 3 = 5 \cdots 1$$

                \( 5 \div 1 = 5 \cdots 0 \), as 5 can be divided by 1 with no remainder. When there is no remainder, we can also not write the dots and the remainder, and simply write \( 5 \div 1 = 5 \). <br>

    The <b>factors</b> of a number are all the numbers that can exactly divide a number. In other words, the factors of a number are all divisors of that number that give a remainder of 0.
    For example, 1, 2, and 4 are all factors of the number 4, as \( 4 \div 1=4 \cdots 0\), \( 4 \div 2=2 \cdots 0\), and \( 4 \div 4=1 \cdots 0\) respectively.<br>
    A number like 3, however, is not a factor of the number 4, since \( 4 \div 3=1 \cdots 1\) has a remainder of 1.

    Now that we know what remainders and factors are, we can finally revisit the divisibility problem.<br>
    A number is divisible by another if and only if the remainder is 0. And since a remainder of 0 can only occur when the divisor is a factor of the dividend, we can conclude that <b>a number is only divisible by its factors</b>.
    <br><br>
    In our original example, when we tried to divide 15 books among 5 people, we were able to do so exactly. In other words, 15 is divisible by 5 because 5 is a factor of 15, therefore the remainder is 0.<br>
    When we tried to divide 16 books among 5 people, we were not able to divide the books exactly. In other words, 16 is not divisible by 5, because 5 is not a factor of 16, therefore the remainder is not 0.
