    Up until now we have dealt with numbers that are greater than 0, which are also called positive numbers. Numbers like \(1\), \(27\), and \(1000000\) are all examples of positive numbers.
    <b>Negative numbers</b> are all numbers that are smaller than 0. Negative numbers are still numbers, and use the same digits as the positive numbers we encountered so far.
    The only difference is, negative numbers have a <b>negative sign</b> (\(-\), also known as a minus sign) in front to indicate that it is a negative number.
    Numbers like \(-1\), \(-27\), and \(-1000000\) are all examples of negative numbers.

    We encounter negative numbers a lot in our daily lives. For example, when the temperature outside is cold, we might have a weather report of it being \(-2\) degrees outside.
    When we spend more money than we have in a bank account, the account statement might show a statement with \(-10\). In some large buildings with basements, an elevator buttons might have a \(-2\) label.
    These are all examples of negative numbers, and they all indicate numbers that are less than 0.

    We can also use the number line to help us understand negative numbers. Up until now we have only dealt with 0 and positive numbers.
    These number lines started with 0 on the far left, and the bigger the number is, the further it is to the right.
    <br>
    <div class="container">
    <figure class="figure">
      <img id="lesson-image-0" class="figure-img img-responsive rounded" style="max-width:50%;">
      <figcaption id="lesson-image-0-caption" class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    Recall that on any number line, smaller numbers are always on the left of larger numbers.
    Because negative numbers are all smaller than 0, we include negative numbers on the number line by extending the number line to the left, like so:
    <br>
    <div class="container">
    <figure class="figure">
      <img id="lesson-image-1" class="figure-img img-responsive rounded" style="max-width:50%;">
      <figcaption id="lesson-image-1-caption" class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    It is important to remember that in any number line, smaller numbers are always on the left of larger numbers.
    This helps us avoid a common mistake that many make when first learning about negative numbers â€” the confusion of which negative number is greater/smaller when comparing negative numbers.
    When we compare positive numbers, we can obviously tell something like \(1 < 2\) (one is less than two).
    When comparing negative numbers, it might not be so obvious to tell that \(-1 > -2\) (negative one is <i>greater</i> than negative two), but a quick reference to the number line will show us that this is true.

                \(-54\) and \(-12\) are negative numbers, and are therefore to the left of \(0\) on the number line.
                \(-54\) is to the left of \(-12\) on the number line, therefore \(54 < 12\).
                \(-54 < -12 < 0 < 1\) is the four numbers ordered from least to greatest.
