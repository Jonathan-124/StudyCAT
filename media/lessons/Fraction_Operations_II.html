    Just like how we can add and subtract whole numbers, we can also add and subtract fractions with one restriction:
    <br><br>
    To add/subtract fractions with a common denominator, simply add/subtract their numerators and leave the denominator the same.
    If two fractions do not have a common denominator, find their equivalent fractions that share a common denominator before adding/subtracting the fractions.
    <br><br>
    Let's see why this is the case using two examples. A pizza is cut into 8 equal slices. If John eats 2 slices and Brenda eats 5, what fraction of the pizza did they eat in total?
    John ate \(\frac{2}{8}\) of the pizza, while Brenda ate \(\frac{5}{8}\). Because the denominators in the two fractions are the same, the total amount of pizza they ate can be found by adding the numerators.
    \(\frac{2+5}{8} = \(\frac{7}{8}\)\), therefore the two ate \(\frac{7}{8}\) of a pizza.

                Because the fractions \(\frac{12}{7}\) and \(\frac{4}{7}\) have the same denominator, we can calculate the difference by subtracting the numerator.
                \(\frac{12}{7} - \frac{4}{7} = \frac{12-4}{7} = \frac{8}{7}\).

    If two fractions do not have the same denominator, we must first find their equivalent fractions with a common denominator before we can add or subtract.
    Using an example to show why: suppose Lily and Jordan have identical pizzas. Lily cuts her pizza into 4 slices, but Jordan cuts her pizza into 8. If Lily eats 2 of her slices and Jordan eats 2 slices of her own, how much pizza did they eat in total?
    Lily eats \(\frac{2}{4}\) of a pizza, while Jordan eats \(\frac{2}{8}\) of a pizza.
    However, each of Lily's slices is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a pizza, while each of Jordan's slices is \(\frac{1}{8}\) of a pizza. We cannot calculate the total amount of pizza they ate just by adding the number of slices, because the slice sizes are different (in other words, the denominators are different numbers)!
    To add the two fractions \(\frac{2}{4}\) and \(\frac{2}{8}\), we need to convert the fractions into their equivalent fractions that share a <b>common denominator</b>.
    <br><br>
    When we have two fractions with different denominators, it's a short two-step process to find their equivalent fractions with a common denominator:
    <ol>
        <li>Find the least common multiple of the denominators (the smallest multiple that exists for both denominators) of the two fractions</li>
        <li>For each fraction, divide this least common multiple by its denominator, then multiply the numerator and denominator with this number to get a new equivalent fraction</li>
    </ol>
    In our pizza example, the multiples of the denominator of \(\frac{2}{4}\) are 4, 8,..., while the multiples of the denominator of \(\frac{2}{8}\) are, 8, 16,... so the least common multiple is 8.
    In the second step, for each fraction we divide 8 by the fraction's denominator, then multiply the result to the numerator and denominator to get an equivalent fraction.
    For \(\frac{2}{4}\), \(8 \div 4 = 2\), so we multiply 2 to the numerator and denominator and get an equivalent fraction of \(\frac{2}{4} = \frac{2 \times 2}{4 \times 2} = \frac{4}{8}\).
    For \(\frac{2}{8}\), \(8 \div 8 = 1\), so we multiply 1 to the numerator and denominator and get an equivalent fraction of \(\frac{2}{8} = \frac{2 \times 1}{8 \times 1} = \frac{2}{8}\).
    <br><br>
    Now that we have found equivalent fractions to the original ones that share a common denominator, we can finally add the fractions!
    The total amount of pizza that Lily and Jordan ate is therefore \(\frac{2}{4} + \frac{2}{8} = \frac{4}{8} + \frac{2}{8} = \frac{6}{8}\).

                Because the fractions \(\frac{1}{3}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\) do not have the same denominator, we need to find their equivalent fractions that share a common denominator before we can subtract them.
                The multiples of 3 (the denominator of the first fraction) are 3, 6, 9, 12,..., and the multiples of 4 (the denominator of the second fraction) are 4, 8, 12,..., so the least common multiple is 12.
                For the first fraction, \(12 \div 3=4\), so an equivalent fraction with denominator 12 can be found by multiplying its numerator and denominator by 4: \(\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 4}{3 \times 4} = \frac{4}{12}\).
                For the second fraction, \(12 \div 4=3\), so an equivalent fraction with denominator 12 can be found by multiplying its numerator and denominator by 3: \(\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1 \times 3}{4 \times 3} = \frac{3}{12}\).
                Finally, we can subtract the fractions using their equivalent fractions that have a common denominator: \(\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{4}{12} - \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{12}\).
