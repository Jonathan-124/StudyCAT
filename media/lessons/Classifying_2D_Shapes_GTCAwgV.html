Previously, we have learned that a two-dimensional shape (or 2D shape) is any "flat" shape that does not have any thickness.
Let's talk a bit more about how we classify the most common 2D shapes we see everyday.
<br><br>
All 2D shapes are either <b>open</b> or <b>closed</b>.
<br>
An open shape has at least one gap, so its sides do not touch. A closed shape has all sides connected to each other.
<br>
<div class="container">
    <figure class="figure">
      <img id="lesson-image-0" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" style="max-width:200px;max-height:200px">
      <figcaption id="lesson-image-0-caption" class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<br>
All closed shapes are either <b>polygons</b> or not polygons.
<br><br>
All polygons can only have <b>edges</b> and <b>vertices</b>.
<br>
Edges are straight line segments that make up the boundary or outline of the shape.
<br>
Vertices are the points where the edges meet. Each vertex is a "corner" where edges meet.
<br><br>
So in other words, a closed shape drawn with only straight lines is a polygon, and any closed shape that includes non-straight lines is not a polygon!

    <figure class="figure">
      <img id="lesson-image-1" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" style="max-width:200px;max-height:200px">
      <figcaption id="lesson-image-1-caption" class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="figure">
      <img id="lesson-image-2" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" style="max-width:200px;max-height:200px">
      <figcaption id="lesson-image-2-caption" class="figure-caption"></figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

Here's a short summary of how we've categorized our 2D shapes so far.
  <ul>
    <li>2D shape</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Open shape</li>
          <li>Closed shape</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Polygon</li>
                <li>Non-polygon</li>
            </ul>
      </ul>
    <li>3D shape</li>
  </ul>
