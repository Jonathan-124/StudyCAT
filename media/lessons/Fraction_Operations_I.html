    Just like how we can multiply and divide whole numbers, we can also multiply and divide fractions with each other.
    <br><br>
    To multiply a fraction with another fraction, we simply multiply their numerators together to get the resulting fraction's numerator, and multiply their denominators together to get the resulting fraction's denominator.
    For example, if we want to multiply \(\frac{2}{3}\) and \(\frac{2}{5}\), we multiply them like so \(\frac{2 \times 2}{3 \times 5}\) to get the result of \(\frac{4}{15}\).

                The correct answer is \(\frac{5}{9}\).
                <br><br>
                \(\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{2 \times 5}{3 \times 6} = \frac{10}{18}\). \(\frac{10}{18}\) is not a simplified fraction, as 10 and 16 have a common factor of 2.
                \(\frac{10}{18} = \frac{10 \div 2}{18 \div 2} = \frac{5}{9}\), therefore \(\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{10}{18}= \frac{5}{9}\).

    To divide a fraction and another fraction, we first <b>invert</b> the divisor fraction by switching its numerator and denominator, then <b>multiply</b> the dividend by this new inverted fraction.
    For example, if we want calculate \(\frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{5}\), we first invert the divisor \(\frac{1}{5}\) to get a new fraction \(\frac{5}{1}\). Then, we multiply the dividend with the new fraction like so \(\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{5}{1} = \frac{2 \times 5}{3 \times 1}\) to get the result of \(\frac{6}{5}\).

                \(\frac{5}{2} \div \frac{3}{4} = \frac{5}{2} \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 3} = \frac{20}{6}\). \(\frac{20}{6}\) is not a simplified fraction, as 20 and 6 have a common factor of 2.
                \(\frac{20}{6} = \frac{20 \div 2}{6 \div 2} = \frac{10}{3}\), therefore \(\frac{5}{2} \div \frac{3}{4} = \frac{20}{6}= \frac{10}{3}\).

    As an aide, up until now, we've said that the denominator of a fraction represents how many equal "pieces" we are splitting each unit into, while the numerator represents how many of these units we are counting.
    For example, if we had \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a candy bar, the denominator 3 represents the number of equal pieces each candy bar is divided into, and the numerator 2 represents the number of pieces we are counting.

    If you haven't noticed already, what we are doing with fractions is exactly what we do when we divide! In other words, the definition of a fraction is exactly the same as the definition for division!
    In a fraction, the numerator is divided equally into the denominator number of parts; when we divide, the dividend is divided equally into the divisor number of parts.
    In fact, the division sign \(\div \) actually represents a fraction, where the dots on the top/bottom represent the numerator/denominator respectively, and the horizontal line is the same as the one in fractions.
