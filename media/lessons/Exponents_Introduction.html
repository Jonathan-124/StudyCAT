    Recall that one way multiplication is defined is a way to denote a number added to itself many times.
    For example, computing \( 5+5+5+5+5+5 \) is the same as computing \( 5 \times 6 \).
    This begs the question, is there a simple way to denote a number multiplied by itself many times?
    <br><br>
    <b>Exponents</b> (also known as <b>powers</b>) are used to denote a number multiplied by itself many times.
    The number that is being multiplied is called the <b>base</b>, while the number of times it is multiplied to itself is called the <b>exponent</b>.
    The exponent is always written on the top-right of the base as a small number.
    <br><br>
    For example, \( 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5\) is a number multiplied by itself, so this expression can be written as an exponent.
    The base is the number being multiplied, which is 5 in this case. The exponent is the number of times it is being multiplied, which is 6 in this example.
    The same expression written as an exponent becomes \(5^6\), where 5 is the base and 6 is the exponent.

                <br><br>
                The base is the number that is being multiplied to itself, which is 4 in this case. It is being multiplied to itself 3 times, so 3 is the exponent. The exponent is always written on the top-right of the base as a small number, so \(4 \times 4 \times 4 = 4^3\).<br>

    When describing an exponent using words, we usually say "{base} to the power of {exponent}". For example, putting \(2^3=8\) into words, we say "2 to the power of 3 equals 8".
    <br><br>
    Another way to describe an exponent with an exponent of 2 or 3 is to say "{base} squared" or "{base} cubed" respectively.
    For example, "3 squared" means \(3^2\), while "2 cubed" means \(2^3\).
