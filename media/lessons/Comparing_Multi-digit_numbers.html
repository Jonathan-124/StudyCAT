    Even though it is easier to use <b>digits</b> instead of words to represent numbers, we only have ten digits in total (0-9).
    This brings us to a very important question: how do you use digits to represent numbers bigger than 9?
    This is where <b>place value</b> comes in.
    <br><br>
    Let's look at how we write the number "ten" using digits. Instead of creating a new digit from scratch, we re-use the digits 1 and 0 to write "ten" as 10.
    In other words, we write bigger numbers with more than one digit.
    <br><br>
    Because we now have numbers with more than one digit, we call the position of a digit its <b>place</b>, and the value of the digit at its place the <b>place value</b>.
    In numbers with two digits, the place on the right is called the <b>ones' place</b>, and the place on the left is called the <b>tens' place</b>.
    <br><br>
    For example, the number 14 is a two-digit number. The place value of its ones' place is 4, and the place value of its tens' place is 1.
    <br>
    Here's another example. The number 32 is a two-digit number. The place value of its ones' place is 2, and the place value of its tens' place is 3.
    <br><br>
    Let's talk a little more about counting numbers with two digits.
    With any two digit number that ends with a digit other than 9, to write the next number that is bigger by one we simply change the digit in the ones' place to the next digit.
    For example, here is a list of numbers from ten to nineteen.
    <br><br>
    What about numbers with more than two digits? What are the names of the places?
    <br>
    As a general rule, for a number with any number of digits, we always assign place first to the digit in the right-most position, then proceed to the left.
    Here is a table of how we assign place based on position for numbers up to a million.
    <table class="table w-auto">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">Position</th>
        <th scope="col">Place</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
      <tr>
        <td>Right-most position</td>
        <td>Ones' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>One spot left of the right-most position</td>
        <td>Tens' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Two spots left of the right-most position</td>
        <td>Hundreds' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Three spots left of the right-most position</td>
        <td>Thousands' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Four spots left of the right-most position</td>
        <td>Ten-thousands' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Five spots left of the right-most position</td>
        <td>Hundred-thousands' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Six spots left of the right-most position</td>
        <td>Millions' place</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    Here's an example. What are the places and place values of the number 18453?<br>
    We start from the digit in the right-most position. The right-most digit occupies the ones' place, and has place-value of 3.
    Then, we go to the digit one spot to the left. It occupies the tens' place, and has place-value of 5.
    Then, we go to the digit one spot to the left. It occupies the hundreds' place, and has place-value of 4.
    Then, we go to the digit one spot to then left. It occupies the thousands' place, and has place-value of 8.
    Finally, we go to the digit one spot to the left. It occupies the ten-thousands' place, and has place-value of 1.
    <br><br>
    Here's another example. The what is the place-value of the ten-thousands' place in the number 324906?
    From the table above, we know that the digit in the ten-thousands' place is always four spots left of the right-most position.
    The digit in the ten-thousands' place of 324906 is 2.
    Since the place-value of a place is just the digit that occupies that place, the place-value of the ten-thousands' place in 324906 is 2.
