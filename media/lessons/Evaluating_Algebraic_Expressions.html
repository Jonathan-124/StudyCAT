    Recall that we use variables to represent quantities that we do not know.
    <br><br>
    For example, a business owner has to pay each of his employees 50 dollars.
    If we define the variable \(x\) to be the total number of employees there are and define \(y\) to be the total amount of money the business owner has to pay his employees, then we get the following expression:
    $$ y = 50x $$
    Let's say that we find out that there are a total of 4 employees. How do we find the total amount of money the owner has to pay?
    We already know that the total amount of money the business owner has to pay is the total number of employees times 50, or in other words \(y = 50x\),
    Because we now know that \(x = 4\), we can use this new information to find \(y\), the total amount of money the owner has to pay by substituting \(x\) out for 4!
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    y &= 50x \\ y &= 50 \times 4 \\ y &= 200
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    Therefore the owner has to pay a total of 200 dollars to his employees.
    <br><br>
    What we have done is "plug in" a number for a variable. In other words, we have substituted the variable in for a number!
    Because each variable represents some number that we do not know, once we know what the number is, we can simply replace the variable with the number we are given and evaluate the expression.

                <br><br>
                Since \(x\) is the number of minutes the ice cream has been taken out of the freezer, \(x = 10\).
                We are asked to find \(y\), the temperature of the ice cream when \(x=10\), so we plug in 10 in place of \(x\).
