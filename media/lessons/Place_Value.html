    Even though it is easier to use <b>digits</b> instead of words to represent numbers, we only have ten digits in total (0-9).
    This brings us to a very important question: how do you use digits to represent numbers bigger than 9?
    This is where <b>place value</b> comes in.
    <br><br>
    Let's look at how we write the number "ten" using digits. Instead of creating a new digit from scratch, we re-use the digits 1 and 0 to write "ten" as 10.
    In other words, we write bigger numbers with more than one digit.
    <br><br>
    Because we now have numbers with more than one digit, we call the position of a digit its <b>place</b>, and the value of the digit at its place the <b>place value</b>.
    In numbers with two digits, the place on the right is called the ones' place, and the place on the left is called the tens' place.
    <br><br>
    For example, the number 14 is a two-digit number. The place value of its ones' place is 4, and the place value of its tens' place is 1.
    <br>
    Here's another example. The number 32 is a two-digit number. The place value of its ones' place is 2, and the place value of its tens' place is 3.
    <br><br>
    What about numbers with more than two digits? What are the names of the places?
    <br><br>
    As a general rule, for a number with any number of digits, <b>we always assign place to digits from right to left </b>. In other words, we start from the digit in the right-most position, then proceed to the left one digit at a time.
    Here is a table of how we assign place based on position for numbers up to a million.
    <table class="table w-auto">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">Position</th>
        <th scope="col">Place</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
      <tr>
        <td>Right-most position</td>
        <td>Ones' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>One spot left of the right-most position</td>
        <td>Tens' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Two spots left of the right-most position</td>
        <td>Hundreds' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Three spots left of the right-most position</td>
        <td>Thousands' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Four spots left of the right-most position</td>
        <td>Ten-thousands' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Five spots left of the right-most position</td>
        <td>Hundred-thousands' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Six spots left of the right-most position</td>
        <td>Millions' place</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    Here's an example. What is the place value in each place in the number 18453?<br>
    We start from the digit in the right-most position. The right-most digit occupies the ones' place, and has place-value of 3.
    Then, we go to the digit one spot to the left. It occupies the tens' place, and has place-value of 5.
    Then, we go to the digit one spot to the left. It occupies the hundreds' place, and has place-value of 4.
    Then, we go to the digit one spot to then left. It occupies the thousands' place, and has place-value of 8.
    Finally, we go to the digit one spot to the left. It occupies the ten-thousands' place, and has place-value of 1.
    <br><br>
    Here's another example. What is the place-value of the ten-thousands' place in the number 324906?
    From the table above, we know that the digit in the ten-thousands' place is always four spots left of the right-most position.
    The digit in the ten-thousands' place of 324906 is 2.
    Since the place-value of a place is just the digit that occupies that place, the place-value of the ten-thousands' place in 324906 is 2.
