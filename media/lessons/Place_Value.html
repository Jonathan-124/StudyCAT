    Even though it is easier to use <b>digits</b> instead of words to represent numbers, we only have ten digits in total (0-9).
    This brings us to a very important question: how do we use digits to represent numbers bigger than 9?
    This is where <b>place value</b> comes in.
    <br><br>
    Let's look at how we write the number "ten" using digits. Instead of creating a new digit from scratch, we re-use the digits 1 and 0 to write "ten" as 10.
    In other words, we write bigger numbers with more than one digit.
    <br><br>
    Because we now have numbers with more than one digit, we call the position of a digit its <b>place</b>, and the value of the digit in its place the <b>place value</b>.
    In numbers with two digits, the place on the right is called the ones' place, and the place on the left is called the tens' place.
    <br><br>
    For example, the number 32 is a two-digit number. The place value of its ones' place is 2, and the place value of its tens' place is 3.

              The correct answer is "Ones' place".
              <br><br>
              The number is a two-digit number, and the digit 4 occupies the place on the right, which is the one's place.
              Since the digit 1 is in the tens' place, the tens' place (not the ones' place) has a place value of 1, so the second choice is incorrect. There are no places called left and right places, so the last two choices are incorrect.

    What about numbers with more than two digits? What are the names of the places?
    <br><br>
    As a general rule, <b>for a number with any number of digits, we always assign place to digits from right to left </b>. In other words, we start from the digit in the right-most position, then proceed to the left one place at a time.
    Here is a table of how we assign place for numbers up to a million.
    <br><br>
    <table class="table">
    <thead class="thead-light">
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">Position</th>
        <th scope="col">Place</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
      <tr>
        <td>Right-most place</td>
        <td>Ones' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Second place from the right</td>
        <td>Tens' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Third place from the right</td>
        <td>Hundreds' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Fourth place from the right</td>
        <td>Thousands' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Fifth place from the right</td>
        <td>Ten-thousands' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Sixth place from the right</td>
        <td>Hundred-thousands' place</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Seventh from the right</td>
        <td>Millions' place</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    Here's an example. What is the place value of each place in the number 18453?<br>
    We start from the digit in the right-most position. The right-most digit occupies the ones' place, and has place-value of 3.<br>
    Then, we go to the digit one spot to the left. It occupies the tens' place, and has place-value of 5.<br>
    Then, we go to the digit one spot to the left. It occupies the hundreds' place, and has place-value of 4.<br>
    Then, we go to the digit one spot to then left. It occupies the thousands' place, and has place-value of 8.<br>
    Finally, we go to the digit one spot to the left. It occupies the ten-thousands' place, and has place-value of 1.

          <h5>Exercise 2</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
          <p>What is the place-value of the ten-thousands' place in the number 324906?</p>
          <br>
          <a class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="collapse" href="#ex2-solution" onclick="this.innerHTML = (this.innerHTML == 'Show solution' ? 'Hide solution' : 'Show solution');" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="ex2-solution">Show solution</a>

          <div class="card-footer">
              The correct answer is 2.
              <br><br>
              Using the table above, we know that the ten-thousands' place is the fifth place from the right. The digit 2 occupies this place, so the ten-thousands' place in 324906 has a place value of 2.
