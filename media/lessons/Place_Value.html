    Consider this question. Which number is bigger, twenty three thousand six hundred forty three or four thousand eight hundred sixty three?
    It is difficult to do this comparison in our heads, since it is hard to visualize the numbers directly.
    Fortunately, we can always follow four simple steps to figure out which of two numbers is bigger, even when the numbers are very large.
    <br><br>
    The four steps are as follows:
    <ol>
        <li>Write down both numbers using digits. </li>
        <li>Compare the amount of places/digits the two numbers have. If they do not have the same amount of places, the number with more places is bigger.</li>
        <li>If the two numbers have the same amount of digits, compare the left-most place of the two numbers. The number with the bigger digit left-most place is bigger.</li>
        <li>If the left-most place of the two numbers are the same digit, cross out the left-most place of both numbers. Repeat from step 3.</li>
    </ol>
    Let's try to tackle the original example using this four-step process.<br>
    Which number is bigger, twenty three thousand six hundred forty three or four thousand eight hundred sixty three?
    <ul>
        <li>23643 and 4863 are the two numbers written using digits.</li>
        <li>The first number has 5 places, and the second number has 4. So the first number is bigger, and we're done!</li>
    </ul>
    Let's try another example.<br>
    Which number is bigger, 1327 or 1389?
    <ul>
        <li>1027 and 1089 are already written using digits.</li>
        <li>Both numbers have 4 places, so we need to go to step 3.</li>
        <li>The left-most place of the two numbers contain the same digit, 1.</li>
        <li>Since the left-most place of both numbers contain 1, the same digit, we cross out the left-most digit in the two numbers and repeat from step 3.</li>
        <li>Now, the left-most place of the two numbers contain the same digit, 0.</li>
        <li>Since the left-most place of both numbers contain 0, the same digit, we cross out the left-most digit in the two numbers and repeat from step 3.</li>
        <li>Now, the left-most place of the first number contains the digit 2 and the left-most place of the second number contains the digit 8. So the second number is bigger, and we're done!</li>
    </ul>
    Finally, let's try this example. <br>
    Which of the following signs (\( <, =, > \)) goes in the box \( 185 \square 564 \)?
    <ul>
        <li>185 and 564 are already written using digits.</li>
        <li>Both numbers have 3 places, so we need to go to step 3.</li>
        <li>the left-most place of the first number contains the digit 1 and the left-most place of the second number contains the digit 5. The second number is bigger!</li>
    </ul>
    Recall that the pointy end of the comparison sign always points to the smaller number. So \( < \) is the correct sign to fill in the box.
