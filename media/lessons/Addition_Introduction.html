Let's start with an example. If Anna has 2 cookies and Bob has 4 cookies, how many cookies do they have in total?
<br>
I'm sure we can all figure out that they have 6 cookies in total. But let's take a step back and think about how we got the answer.
We first counted the 2 cookies that Anna had. Then, we counted 4 more to get the total.
<br><br>
In short, we have performed <b>addition</b>!
When you have two groups of things (cookies in this case), and want to know the total amount, you <b>add</b> the two numbers together.
<br><br>
To rephrase what we did in the example more simply, we could say '2 plus 4 ', where <b>plus</b> is another way to say 'add'.
Because writing 'plus' becomes tiring after a while, we use the symbol \( + \) (called a <b>plus sign</b>) instead to write it as
$$ 2+4 $$
Since the result of \( 2+4 \) is equal to 6, we can also write
$$ 2+4=6 $$
Let's go through two more examples.
<br><br>
Calculate \( 3+5 \).<br>
We first count to 3. Then, we count 5 more from 3, and get 8.
Because the result of \( 3+5 \) is the same as the number 8, we write \( 3+5=8 \).
<br><br>
Charlie has five hats and Dylan has two hats. How many hats do they have in total?
First, let's write the numbers using digits. Charlie has 5 hats, and Dylan has 2.
Because we are counting the total number of hats, we add the two numbers and write it as \( 5+2 \).
Finally, because the result of \( 5+2 \) is the same as the number 7, we write \( 5+2=7 \).
<br><br>
To summarize addition:
<ul>
  <li>Addition calculates the total of two numbers.</li>
  <li>Addition is represented by the plus sign (\( + \)).</li>
</ul>
