    Let's say that Josh has a couple of cookies in his pocket, and Emily has some cookies in her pocket as well.
    Let's also say that although we don't know how many cookies Josh and Emily each have, we know for a fact that they have 9 cookies in total among the two of them.
    We could represent this information with an equation like so:
    $$\text{the number of cookies that Josh has} + \text{the number of cookies that Emily has} = 9 $$
    The equation represents the information we know correctly, but it is not very easy to read because of all the text we have.
    What we can do instead is to use something shorter as substitutes for the long strings of text, like so:
    $$ x = \text{the number of cookies that Josh has} \\ y = \text{the number of cookies that Emily has}$$
    Now we can represent the same equation in a much simpler fashion:
    $$ x + y = 9$$
    <b>Variables</b> are what we use to represent quantities that we do not know. In this example, \(x\) and \(y\) are the variables.
    Variables are often used to simply represent an idea or quantity like "the number of cookies that Josh has" in the example above.
    <br><br>
    We can define anything as a variable, and as long as the variables are defined properly and the equations are set up correctly, there would be no problem.
    For example, we can represent the same example with different variables ðŸ˜‡ and ðŸ˜ˆ like so:
    $$\text{ðŸ˜‡} = \text{the number of cookies that Josh has} \\ \text{ðŸ˜ˆ} = \text{the number of cookies that Emily has} \\ \text{ðŸ˜‡} + \text{ðŸ˜ˆ} = 9$$
    Notice how even though we used new variables, the new equation is still giving us the same information as before.

    Although it is possible to define anything as a variable, to avoid confusion and hassle we follow two rules of thumb when defining variables in math:
    <ol>
        <li>Variables should be a single alphabetical letter</li>
        <li>\(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are the most common variables that we use</li>
    </ol>

                Barbie has \(x\) toys and Ken has \(y\) toys.
                We are given the fact that Barbie has four more toys than Ken, meaning that \(x\) is 4 more than \(y\).
                This information could either be written down as \(x = y + 4\).

                Jackson has \(x\) dollars, so after spending 5 dollars he will have \(x-5\) dollars.
                Since we know that after spending the money he will have 14 dollars, we know that \(x-5 = 14\).

    A final thing to note with variables is that when we are multiplying a variable with a number, we do not use a multiplication sign.
    Instead, we write the number that we are multiplying the variable with directly in front of the variable with no space in between them.
    For example, instead of writing \(x \times 5\) or \(5 \times x\), we write \(5x\) instead.
    This is because the multiplication sign \(\times\) is very similar to the variable \(x\), and we do not want to be confused.
